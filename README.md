<h4>
  About me
</h4>
<span>
I'm an Information Systems student who is passionate on full-stack web and software development.  What I enjoy most about coding is the satisfaction of making ideas come to life and the problem solving aspect that comes with it.
</span>

<h4>
  Skills
</h4>
<span>
I'm primarily focused on full-stack web development using Javascript frameworks such as React and Next.js and express as the backend.  I also have experience in using mySQL and mongoDB in my projects.

<h4>Past Projects</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PCGURO</strong> <span> - An online PC forum which includes a system builder and a store review section.  It was built using react as the framework and express and mongoDB for the back-end</span>
  </li>
   <li><strong>Simply Cookie</strong> <span> - An experimental e-commerce website to handle online orders for the business.  The main goal for the design of the website is for it to be responsive and to have fluid interface animations.  New technologies such as Next.js for the framework, framer motion for the animations, and SASS for the styling, were also in making this website.</span>
  </li>
   <li><strong>Milaor Inventory System</strong> <span> - This website was built to manage and track the flow of inventories and item consumption of the client, a truck logistics company.  The website is also able to generate reports as well as compute and suggest what items to be restocked and ordered.  The technologies used for this project are Next.js and mongoDB</span>
